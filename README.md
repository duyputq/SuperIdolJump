# JumpIdol Game

### Introduce to Game
JumpIdol is a game that controls the character to jump high over obstacles to reach the top destination. Falling into the "lava" area below means death, reaching the destination means victory. The game moves with the left and right arrow keys, and uses the space bar to jump.
