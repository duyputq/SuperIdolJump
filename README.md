# JumpIdol Game

### Introduce to Game
JumpIdol is a game that controls the character to jump high over obstacles to reach the top destination. Falling into the "lava" area below at the bottom of level 1 map means death, reaching the destination of the last level map means victory. If the character to the final and reach the flag (or princess maybe), he'll become "idol". The game moves with the left and right arrow keys, and uses the space bar to jump.
